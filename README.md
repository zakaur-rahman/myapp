## Project Title: Weather App

## Description:
The Weather App project is a web application that allows users to search for and view weather information for different locations. Users can enter the name of a city or a location, and the app will display current weather conditions along with additional details such as temperature, humidity, and current feel.

**Key Features:**
1. **Location Search:** Users can enter the name of a city or location to retrieve weather information.

2. **Current Weather:** The app will display the current weather conditions, including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.

4. **Responsive Design:** The app will be designed to work well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

**Technologies Used:**
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Axios: HTTP client for making API requests to fetch weather data.
- OpenWeatherMap API: External API used to retrieve weather information.
- CSS: Styling the app's user interface.
- Node.js and npm: Required for setting up the development environment.

**Steps to Run the Project:**

1. **Create a React App:**
   Open a terminal and run the following command to create a new React app (replace `weather-app` with your desired project name):

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app weather-app
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the necessary dependencies, including Axios:

   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```

4. **API Key Setup:**
   Sign up on the OpenWeatherMap website to get an API key. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API key like this:

   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Build the Weather App:**
   Replace the default React code in `src/App.js` with your Weather App code. Use Axios to make API requests to fetch weather data using your API key.

6. **Styling and Layout:**
   Use CSS to style your app's user interface. You can style components, create layouts, and apply responsive design principles.

7. **Start the Development Server:**
   Start the React development server by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

8. **Accessing the Weather App:**
   Access the Weather App by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000` (assuming the development server is running on port 3000).

9. **Testing and Development:**
   Test your Weather App by entering different locations and checking if the weather information is displayed correctly. Make necessary adjustments to the UI and functionality as needed.
